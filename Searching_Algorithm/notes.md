# Available searching Algorithms provided by js
  # A) LINEAR SEARCH
   -- its time complexity is O(n)
   
 a) .includes   -->[ returns true if there is an item]  
                              [returns false if there is no that item]

  b) .indexOf  --> [returns (indexPosition) if there is an item]  
                                [returns (-1) if there is no that item]

  c) .find          --> [returns (nameOfThatItem) if there is an item] 
                              [returns (undefined) if there is an item]

# B)  BINARY SEARCH
  -- onlu works on sorted arrays 
  -- faster than linear search 
  -- its time complexity is O(log n)
